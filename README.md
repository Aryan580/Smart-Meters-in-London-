The data was divided on the basis of Daily, every half and hour and hourly energy consumption. Further, there are in total 112 blocks with with their smart meter monitering and collecting energy consumption. A sum of every block was taken, representing the overall Daily energy consumption of each block using Python. It's Python code is also presented in main repository. This repository also includes EDA performed in Acorn demographic's dataset.

The Energy Consumption are as follows:-
    
      1. energy_median
      2. energy_mean
      3. energy_max
      4. energy_count
      5. energy_std
      6. energy_sum
      7. energy_min
